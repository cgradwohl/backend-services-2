## Global Configuration

- nx provides application config files that extend the global config files
- `nx.json` contains metadata about your workspace and its applications

## Application Configuration

- the `/apps` folder contains each microservice or deployable unit
- `project.json` defines an individual application in your workspace and the _tasks_ available to it
- each app should have a `build`, `serve`, `lint`, `deploy` and `test` task defined for it

## Typescript Config

- `typescript.base.json` `path` and `basePath` properties cannot be extended but rather is replaced by the local services `tsconfig.json`

## Migration Notes

- copy package.json dependencies from `backend/package.json` to `backend-services-2/package.json`
- `yarn`
- copy `backend` serverless application to `backend-services-2/apps/backend` as is no file structure changes.
- updated `backend-services-2/apps/backend/tsconfig.json` to extend ``backend-services-2/tsconfig.base.json`
- remove `backend-services-2/apps/backend/.git`
- 游릭 running `yarn nx typecheck backend` works (see #Breaking Folder Convention and Migration Suggestion below for details)
- 游릭 running `yarn nx serverless:package backend` works (see #Breaking Folder Convention and Migration Suggestion below for details)
- 游릭 running `yarn nx test:dev backend` works and tests pass locally (see #Breaking Folder Convention and Migration Suggestion below for details)
- 游릭 running `yarn nx serverless:deploy backend` works and deploys the stack based on dev-config.yml (see #Breaking Folder Convention and Migration Suggestion below for details)

### Breaking Folder Convention and Migration Suggestion

- after following NX's migration sugestions I realized that splitting Configuration files to go in the root of your application, and application code goes into the src/app folder was problematic and required changing webpack config, tsconfig, and serverless webpack plugin. It is not clear why this is necessary, but it is NX's suggestion.

- for now i will shove everything into the src folder so that all the relative paths are the same. (get it to work mode)
- decided to completely abandon nx file structure

- this seems to get backend working, but I do not know the consequences this will have later down the road, when we attempt to do more sophisticated tasks with NX. I am hoping that this is isolated to this service.

### Deployment Nuance

- during the compilation phase, serverless-webpack is not building correctly since it is not including
  the required source maps required by the serverless framework to deploy to CloudFormation.
