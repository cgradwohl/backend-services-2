# Courier Elemental Evaluation Lib

This folder contains the lib for evaluating the control flow logic of an elemental template.

This entails:

- Semantic analysis of the template (finding errors, etc.)
- Generating looped elements
- Filtering channel specific elements
- Evaluating element conditions and hiding / showing them based on the results
